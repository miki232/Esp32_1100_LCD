# Raycast Algorithm Simulation with ESP32 and Nokia 1100 LCD

This project aims to simulate a Raycast Algorithm using an ESP32 board and displaying the results on a Nokia 1100 LCD.

## Introduction
The Raycast Algorithm is a technique used in computer graphics to render 3D scenes in a 2D environment. In this project, we implement a simplified version of the Raycast Algorithm using an ESP32 board and a Nokia 1100 LCD.
The Raycasting algorithm is based on the tutorial by Lode Vandevenne: http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html 

## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following hardware components:
- ESP32 board
- Nokia 1100 LCD
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- PushButton

To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Connect the ESP32 board to the Nokia 1100 LCD and button using the breadboard and jumper wires. Take a look to the main.ino file for pin reference
2. Install the necessary libraries for ESP32 board on the Arduino Ide.
3. Upload the project code to your ESP32 board.

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use it to simulate the Raycast Algorithm. The algorithm will generate a 2D representation of a 3D scene on the Nokia 1100 LCD. You can modify the scene parameters and customize the rendering process according to your needs.
